# ReverseGuessingGame
A game where the computer tries to guess your chosen number

Tell the computer whether your chosen number is higher, lower, or the same as the computer's guess. Once the computer guesses the right number, it will tell you how many tries it took.
Your goal is to make the computer make as many guesses as possible!
