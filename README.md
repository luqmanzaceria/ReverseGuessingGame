# ReverseGuessingGame
A game where the computer tries to guess your chosen number

In this game you first choose your number. The computer will then output the guessed number and you should tell the computer if the guessed number is higher, lower, or the same as the computer's guess. Once the computer guesses the right number, it will tell you how many tries it took.
Your goal is to make the computer make as many guesses as possible!
